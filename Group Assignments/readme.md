## Research Question
Which S&P 500 companies have the highest influence on the stock market?

## Agenda
This project will magnify the true influence an individual S&P 500 company has on the stock market, this can help if determining whether or not a company has too much influence and thus help determine if a company (monopoly) or multiple companies (oligopoly) should be dismantled.

## Spatial Scope
The spatial scope is the global market because companies around the globe have influence on the stock market.

## Data Sources
[S&P 500 Companies with Financial Information](https://datahub.io/core/s-and-p-500-companies-financials)
contains a list of all companies in the S&P 500, all stocks, as well as associated key financials (price, market capitalization, earnings, price/earnings ratio, etc.).

[Fortune 500 Corporate Headquarters](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/fortune-500-corporate-headquarters/data)
contains a list of fortune 500 companies' headquarters (including: Address, Latitude, Longitude, etc.).

## Analysis Scope
An interactive choropleth map will help with visualizing a companyâ€™s influence, with a darker bolder shade representing a higher influence.

## Conclusion
I expect that my research will magnify the influence an S&P 500 company has on the stock market and whether it is too much influence in the hands of one (or more) company(ies).
